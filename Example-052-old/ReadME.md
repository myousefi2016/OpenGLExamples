<H3>The <i>'Example-052 (Old Mode)'</i> Test</H3>

The <i>'Example-052 (Old Mode)'</i> Test draws several portions of the <i>'Square Annulus'</i> shape in an <A href="http://www.opengl.org"><i>OpenGL</i></A> window. This shape is bounded by <code><i>'2'</i></code> (concentric) axis-parallel rectangles of different size in the same spirit of a circular crown. It is often known as the <i>'rectangular'</i> crown. Its large rectangle is called the <i>'external'</i> rectangle, and other rectangle is called the <i>'internal'</i> rectangle. Thus, it requires at least <code><i>'8'</i></code> vertices with their optional attributes (colors).<p>Here, the <i>'Square Annulus'</i> shape of interest is approximated by an unique triangle strip, formed by <code><i>'8'</i></code> triangles, without adding any <i>'Steiner'</i> point. By construction, it is necessary to enumerate a collection of <code><i>'10'</i></code> points with their independent colors (<code><i>'2'</i></code> points and their colors are needed to be duplicated).<p>For the sake of the efficiency, we exploit a centralized data organization, consisting of <code><i>'2'</i></code> matrices, such that their rows contain, respectively, the <code>'3D'</code> coordinates and the colors for all <code><i>'8'</i></code> vertices (with no redundancy). Hence, it is sufficient to access the locations of indices <code><i>'0,...,8,0,1'</i></code> in <code><i>'2'</i></code> matrices, mentioned above, in order to draw the triangle strip of interest. This technique works, and it is easy to be customized for a different number of vertices, or for a different colors palette. In fact, it is sufficient to modify only the desired rows in the matrices of interest. These matrices may be precomputed in advance and reused many times, if necessary.<p>In order to show the actual validity of this approach, it is possible to limit our attention only on a specific portion of the <i>'Square Annulus'</i> shape, defined by using only <code><i>'n'</i></code> points, such that <code><i>'n'</i></code> is in the range <code><i>'[3,10]'</i></code>. This means that only a subset of all triangles in the triangle strip of interest are drawn. Broadly speaking, every index <code><i>'j'</i></code> in <code><i>'[0,n-1]'</i></code> is generated in order to access <code><i>'2'</i></code> rows of index <code><i>'j % 8'</i></code> in the matrices of interest.<p>In this test, it is not possible to modify the size and the position for the <i>'external'</i> and the <i>'internal'</i> rectangles of the <i>'Square Annulus'</i> shape. Instead, the user can:<p><ul>
<li>increase the maximum number <code><i>'n'</i></code> of points to be considered by pressing the <code><i>'+'</i></code> key;</li>
<li>decrease the maximum number <code><i>'n'</i></code> of points to be considered by pressing the <code><i>'-'</i></code> key;</li></ul><p>and can press cyclically the <code><i>' '</i></code> (space) key for choosing to render:<p><ul>
<li>only the points for the desired triangles in the triangle strip of interest;</li>
<li>the <i>'wireframe versions'</i> for the desired triangles in the triangle strip of interest;</li>
<li>the <i>'filled versions'</i> for the desired triangles in the triangle strip of interest.</li></ul><p>Likewise, the window of interest can be closed by pressing any among the <code><i>'Q'</i></code>, the <code><i>'q'</i></code>, and the <code><i>'Esc'</i></code> keys.<p>
