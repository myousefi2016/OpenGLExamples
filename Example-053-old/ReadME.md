<H3>The <i>'Example-053 (Old Mode)'</i> Test</H3>

The <i>'Example-053 (Old Mode)'</i> Test draws several portions of the <i>'Square Annulus'</i> shape in an <A href="http://www.opengl.org"><i>OpenGL</i></A> window. This shape is bounded by <code><i>'2'</i></code> (concentric) axis-parallel rectangles of different size in the same spirit of a circular crown. It is often known as the <i>'rectangular'</i> crown. Its large rectangle is called the <i>'external'</i> rectangle, and other rectangle is called the <i>'internal'</i> rectangle. Thus, it requires at least <code><i>'8'</i></code> vertices with their optional attributes (colors).<p>Here, the <i>'Square Annulus'</i> shape of interest is approximated by an unique triangle strip, formed by <code><i>'8'</i></code> triangles, without adding any <i>'Steiner'</i> point. By construction, it is necessary to enumerate a collection of <code><i>'10'</i></code> points with their independent colors (<code><i>'2'</i></code> points and their colors are needed to be duplicated).<p>For the sake of the efficiency, we exploit the <i>'vertex array'</i> technique, provided by the <A href="http://www.opengl.org"><i>OpenGL</i></A>. This technique is used to group together several drawing instructions into a unique instruction for rendering (a subset of) the vertices, together with some of their state parameters (like their Euclidean <code>'3D'</code> coordinates and colors). Here, we limit our attention to the Euclidean <code>'3D'</code> coordinates and the colors for all <code><i>'8'</i></code> vertices in the <i>'Square Annulus'</i> shape of interest. In particular, <code><i>'2'</i></code> arrays are defined, containing, respectively, the Euclidean <code>'3D'</code> coordinates and the colors for all <code><i>'8'</i></code> vertices (with no redundancy). This information is stored in every array as <code><i>'8'</i></code> consecutive tuples of <code><i>'3'</i></code> floating-point and integer values, respectively. The locations, containing the Euclidean coordinates and the colors for the point of index <code><i>'j % 8'</i></code> (for any <code><i>'j'</i></code>) are stored in positions <code><i>'3*j'</i></code>, <code><i>'3*j+1'</i></code>, and <code><i>'3*j+2'</i></code>. Hence, it is sufficient to access the locations, related to vertices of indices <code><i>'0,...,8,0,1'</i></code>, in <code><i>'2'</i></code> arrays, mentioned above, in order to draw the triangle strip of interest. In this test, the <i>'glArrayElement()'</i> function is exploited for drawing a specific vertex with its state parameters.<p>In order to show the actual validity of this approach, it is possible to limit our attention only on a specific portion of the <i>'Square Annulus'</i> shape, defined by using only <code><i>'n'</i></code> points, such that <code><i>'n'</i></code> is in the range <code><i>'[3,10]'</i></code>. This means that only a subset of all triangles in the triangle strip of interest are drawn. Broadly speaking, every index <code><i>'j'</i></code> in <code><i>'[0,n-1]'</i></code> is generated in order to access the locations, corresponding to the point of index <code><i>'j % 8'</i></code>, in the arrays of interest.<p>In this test, it is not possible to modify the size and the position for the <i>'external'</i> and the <i>'internal'</i> rectangles of the <i>'Square Annulus'</i> shape. Instead, the user can:<p><ul>
<li>increase the maximum number <code><i>'n'</i></code> of points to be considered by pressing the <code><i>'+'</i></code> key;</li>
<li>decrease the maximum number <code><i>'n'</i></code> of points to be considered by pressing the <code><i>'-'</i></code> key;</li></ul><p>and can press cyclically the <code><i>' '</i></code> (space) key for choosing to render:<p><ul>
<li>only the points for the desired triangles in the triangle strip of interest;</li>
<li>the <i>'wireframe versions'</i> for the desired triangles in the triangle strip of interest;</li>
<li>the <i>'filled versions'</i> for the desired triangles in the triangle strip of interest.</li></ul><p>Likewise, the window of interest can be closed by pressing any among the <code><i>'Q'</i></code>, the <code><i>'q'</i></code>, and the <code><i>'Esc'</i></code> keys.


<table border='1'><tr><td><p><b>IMPORTANT:</b><p>This technique is easy to be customized for a different number of vertices, or for a different colors palette. In fact, it is sufficient to modify only the desired locations in the matrices of interest. These arrays may be precomputed in advance and reused many times, if necessary.

<hr><p><h4>Dependencies</h4>

The <i>'Example-053 (Old Mode)'</i> Test is still based on the so-called <i>OpenGL old (direct drawing) mode</i> (even the use of the <i>'vertex array'</i> technique), and requires the following dependencies:<ul>

<li>the <A href="http://www.opengl.org"><i>OpenGL</i></A> package, distributed with the platform of interest (see the <i><A href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Getting_Started">Official Documentation</A></i>);</li>
<li>the <i><A href="https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/">OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT)</A></i> package (or the <A href="http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/"><i>FreeGLUT</i></A> package);</li>
<li>the <A href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/"><i>OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW)</i></A> package.</li></ul><p>In particular, this test consists of the <i>'Example-053-old'</i> executable file (directly in the <i><code>'bin'</code></i> folder, or in a specific subfolder of the <i><code>'bin'</code></i> folder), starting uniquely from the <i>'main.cpp'</i> C++ source file (in the <i><code>'src'</code></i> folder).<p>Several methods for building this test are provided, and their building infrastructure is saved in the following folders:<p><ul>
<li>the <i><code>'cmake'</code></i> folder contains the project file for the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>;</li>
<li>the <i><code>'vstudio'</code></i> folder contains the solution file for the <i><A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</A></i>;</li>
<li>the <i><code>'xcode'</code></i> folder contains the project file for the <i><A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Apple XCode</A></i>.</li></ul><br><table border=1><tr><td><p><b>ATTENTION:</b><p>The majority of the dependencies for this test are stable, but are currently deprecated, and several warning messages may appear during the building process.<p></td></tr></table><p><hr><p>

<h4>Instructions for building this test with the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i></h4>

This test is built by using the <i>classic</i> instructions for building a program with the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i> from the <i><code>'cmake\'</code></i> folder:
<pre>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
</pre><p>As mentioned above, the <i>'Example-053-old'</i> executable file is saved in (a specific subfolder of) the <i><code>'bin'</code></i> folder. For instance, this test is executed by running:<pre>./bin/Example-053-old</pre><p>This building method is tested with the <A href="http://gcc.gnu.org/"><i>GCC</i></A> under the Ubuntu Linux 16.0.4 (LTS), as well as with the <A href="http://clang.llvm.org/"><i>CLANG</i></A> compiler under the MacOsX 11.* El-Capitan (and higher), and the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A> under the Microsoft Windows 10.<p>In this latter case, three custom projects are automatically generated, and ready to be open in the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A>. The solution file of interest is the <i>'Example-053-old.sln'</i> solution file, which can be exploited without being modified. This test is built by clicking on the <i>'Build'</i> command. The resulting <i>'Example-053-old.exe'</i> executable file is stored in the <i><code>'bin\Debug'</code></i> folder, if the debugging symbols are included, or in the <i><code>'bin\Release'</code></i> folder, otherwise.<p>

All dependencies of the <i>'Example-053 (Old Mode)'</i> Test are supported automatically by the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i> through a built-in manifest file. In particular, they are often pre-installed in a generic GNU/Linux distribution, and distributed in conjunction with the <A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/"><i>Apple XCode</i></A>. Thus, they should be found by the script of interest without problems in these platforms.<p>Instead, these libraries are not standard in the Microsoft Windows, and must be installed properly. For the sake of simplicity, the Win32 versions for the auxiliary libraries of interest in the <i><code>'depends'</code></i> folder are exploited, if the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i> fails while performing their automatic identification. This means that the resulting solution file creates automatically the Win32 version of the <i>'Example-053-old.exe'</i> executable file.<p>An interested user finds more details about other possible customization options in the Official Documentation of the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>.<p><hr><p>

<h4>Instructions for building this test with the <i><A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</A></i></h4>

This test is also built by using the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A>. In particular, the <i><code>'vstudio\'</code></i> folder contains the <i>'Example-053-old.sln'</i> solution file, which can be exploited without being modified. This test is built by clicking on the <i>'Build'</i> command. The resulting <i>'Example-053-old.exe'</i> executable file is stored in the <i><code>'Debug'</code></i> folder, if the debugging symbols are included, or in the <i><code>'Release'</code></i> folder, otherwise.

Note that this solution file is independently created from scratch, and is different from the solution file, which may be generated automatically by the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>.

Specifically, the Win32 versions for the auxiliary libraries of interest in the <i><code>'depends\'</code></i> folder are exploited for building the <i>'Example-053 (Old Mode)'</i> Test. This implies that the <i>'Example-053-old.sln'</i> solution file is set up for including these auxiliary libraries, and it should not be modified, unless you are an expert. Furthermore, it is mandatory to enable the building for a generic Win32 platform for creating correctly the Win32 version of the <i>'Example-053-old.exe'</i> executable file.<p>An interested user finds more details in the Official Documentation of the <i><A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</A></i>.<p><hr><p>
