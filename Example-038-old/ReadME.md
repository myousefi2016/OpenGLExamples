The <i>'Example-038 (Old Mode)'</i> Test draws 2 variants of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape in an <A href="http://www.opengl.org"><i>OpenGL</i></A> window by using the rendering settings, chosen interactively by the user. Broadly speaking, the <i>'Eight'</i> shape represents the <i>'8'</i> number. Intuitively, this shape can be seen as the union of 2 <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shapes, partially overlapped. Recall that any <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shape with <i>'internal'</i> radius <i>'rI'</i>, <i>'external'</i> radius <i>'rE'</i>, and center <i>'(xc,yc)'</i> is defined as follows:<p><pre>| rI * cos(t) | <= | x(t) - xc | <= | rE * cos(t) |, | rI * sin(t) | <= | y(t) - yc | <= | rE * sin(t) |</pre><p>for every <i>'t'</i> in <i>'[-pi,pi]'</i>, and for any <i>'rI'>0</i> and <i>'rE>0'</i>, such that <i>'rI<rE'</i>.<p>In other words, any <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shape is formed by all points in the circular crown, bounded by 2 (concentric) <i>'Circle'</i> shapes (disks) of the same center <i>'(xc,yc)'</i> and of radius <i>'rI'</i> and <i>'rE'</i>, respectively. The disk of radius <i>'rE'</i> is the <i>'external'</i> disk, and the disk of radius <i>'rI'</i> is the <i>'internal'</i> disk.<p>For the sake of simplicity, the <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shape in the superior portion of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape is indicated as the <i>'superior circular crown'</i>, while the <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shape in the inferior portion of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape is indicated as the <i>'inferior circular crown'</i>.<p>Specifically, this test draws the following variants of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape:<p><ol start='0'>
<li>the variant #0 is not <i>'real'</i>, since it is the result of drawing the approximations of 2 complete <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shapes, placed at different z-depths. Note that every <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shape is recursively rendered by drawing its <i>'external'</i> (in <i>'red'</i>) and <i>'internal'</i> (in <i>'white'</i>) disks. The scene is drawn by using the orthographic projection, such that the centers for the <i>'Circle'</i> shapes of interest are projected on the same point. Here, the z-buffer (depth test) technique is exploited. Thus, the result will be always the same, despite the rendering order of the <i>'Circle'</i> shapes. Thus, they only seem to approximate the <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shape, and thus also the <i>'Eight'</i> shape. In particular, there exists a portion of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape, which is shared by the <i>'inferior'</i> and by the <i>'superior circular crown'</i>. All <i>'Circle'</i> shapes of interest are approximated by a triangle fan of <i>'n'</i> vertices (including the center).<p></li>
<li>The variant #1 is a real approximation of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape, and is defined with respect to its horizontal symmetry. Here, the <i>'Eight'</i> shape is decomposed into the <i>'superior'</i> and the <i>'inferior'</i> patches, that correspond (broadly) to its <i>'superior'</i> and the <i>'inferior circular crowns'</i> (but not completely). Every patch is recursively formed by 2 pieces. The first piece is the portion of the corresponding circular crown, which does not contain the intersection with other circular crown. In other words, it is a sector of the corresponding circular crown, and is approximated by a quad strip. This latter is defined on <i>'n'</i> pairs of the corresponding vertices in the <i>'Circle'</i> curves, that bound the <i>'internal'</i> and <i>'external'</i> disks of the corresponding circular crown. Other piece of the patch is a variant of the circular sector in the corresponding circular crown, which is bounded by the frontier of the <i>'internal'</i> disk and by the horizontal symmetry axis. Also this piece is approximated by a quad strip, which is defined on <i>'n'</i> pairs of the corresponding vertices in the horizontal symmetry axis and in the frontier of the <i>'internal'</i> disk.<p>It is clear that both quad strips, approximating these pieces, can be merged into a unique quad strip (in <i>'red'</i>), approximating each patch of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape. This means that the variant #1 of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape is formed by 2 quad strips (both in <i>'red'</i>).<p></li></ol><p>Here, the user cannot modify the radii and the centers for all disks in 2 variants of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape, since they are fixed in advance. Instead, the user can:<p><ul>
<li>increase the number <i>'n'</i> of all vertices in the triangle fans and of the vertices pairs in the triangle strips of interest by pressing the <i>'+'</i> key;</li>
<li>decrease the number <i>'n'</i> of all vertices in the triangle fans and of the vertices pairs in the triangle strips of interest by pressing the <i>'-'</i> key;</li>
<li>choosing to render a specific variant of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape by pressing cyclically the <i>' '</i> key. The settings for rendering their triangles are set independently.</li>
<li>Choosing to render the <i>'wireframe'</i> or the <i>'filled versions'</i> of all triangles in the triangle fans and of the vertices pairs in the triangle strips of interest by pressing cyclically the <i>'w'</i> key. The variant of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape to be drawn is chosen independently.</li></ul><p>Likewise, the window of interest can be closed by pressing any among the <i>'Q'</i>, the <i>'q'</i>, and the <i>'Esc'</i> keys.<p>

<h4>Instructions for building this test with the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i></h4>

This test is built by using the <i>classic</i> instructions for building a program with the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i> from the <i><code>'cmake\'</code></i> folder:
<pre>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
</pre><p>As mentioned above, the <i>'Example-038-old'</i> executable file is saved in (a specific subfolder of) the <i><code>'bin'</code></i> folder. For instance, this test is executed by running:<pre>./bin/Example-038-old</pre><p>This building method is tested with the <A href="http://gcc.gnu.org/"><i>GCC</i></A> under the Ubuntu Linux 16.0.4 (LTS), as well as with the <A href="http://clang.llvm.org/"><i>CLANG</i></A> compiler under the MacOsX 11.* El-Capitan (and higher), and the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A> under the Microsoft Windows 10.<p>In this latter case, three custom projects are automatically generated, and ready to be open in the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A>. The solution file of interest is the <i>'Example-038-old.sln'</i> solution file, which can be exploited without being modified. This test is built by clicking on the <i>'Build'</i> command. The resulting <i>'Example-038-old.exe'</i> executable file is stored in the <i><code>'bin\Debug'</code></i> folder, if the debugging symbols are included, or in the <i><code>'bin\Release'</code></i> folder, otherwise.<p>

All dependencies of the <i>'Example-038 (Old Mode)'</i> Test are supported automatically by the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i> through a built-in manifest file. In particular, they are often pre-installed in a generic GNU/Linux distribution, and distributed in conjunction with the <A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/"><i>Apple XCode</i></A>. Thus, they should be found by the script of interest without problems in these platforms.<p>Instead, these libraries are not standard in the Microsoft Windows, and must be installed properly. For the sake of simplicity, the Win32 versions for the auxiliary libraries of interest in the <i><code>'depends'</code></i> folder are exploited, if the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i> fails while performing their automatic identification. This means that the resulting solution file creates automatically the Win32 version of the <i>'Example-038-old.exe'</i> executable file.<p>An interested user finds more details about other possible customization options in the Official Documentation of the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>.<p><hr><p>

<h4>Instructions for building this test with the <i><A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</A></i></h4>

This test is also built by using the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A>. In particular, the <i><code>'vstudio\'</code></i> folder contains the <i>'Example-038-old.sln'</i> solution file, which can be exploited without being modified. This test is built by clicking on the <i>'Build'</i> command. The resulting <i>'Example-038-old.exe'</i> executable file is stored in the <i><code>'Debug'</code></i> folder, if the debugging symbols are included, or in the <i><code>'Release'</code></i> folder, otherwise.

Note that this solution file is independently created from scratch, and is different from the solution file, which may be generated automatically by the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>.

Specifically, the Win32 versions for the auxiliary libraries of interest in the <i><code>'depends\'</code></i> folder are exploited for building the <i>'Example-038 (Old Mode)'</i> Test. This implies that the <i>'Example-038-old.sln'</i> solution file is set up for including these auxiliary libraries, and it should not be modified, unless you are an expert. Furthermore, it is mandatory to enable the building for a generic Win32 platform for creating correctly the Win32 version of the <i>'Example-038-old.exe'</i> executable file.<p>An interested user finds more details in the Official Documentation of the <i><A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</A></i>.<p><hr><p>
