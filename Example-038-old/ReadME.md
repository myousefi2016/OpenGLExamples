The <i>'Example-038 (Old Mode)'</i> Test draws 2 variants of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape in an <A href="http://www.opengl.org"><i>OpenGL</i></A> window by using the rendering settings, chosen interactively by the user. Broadly speaking, the <i>'Eight'</i> shape represents the <i>'8'</i> number. Intuitively, this shape can be seen as the union of 2 <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shapes, partially overlapped. Recall that any <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shape with <i>'internal'</i> radius <i>'rI'</i>, <i>'external'</i> radius <i>'rE'</i>, and center <i>'(xc,yc)'</i> is defined as follows:<p><pre>| rI * cos(t) | <= | x(t) - xc | <= | rE * cos(t) |, | rI * sin(t) | <= | y(t) - yc | <= | rE * sin(t) |</pre><p>for every <i>'t'</i> in <i>'[-pi,pi]'</i>, and for any <i>'rI'>0</i> and <i>'rE>0'</i>, such that <i>'rI<rE'</i>.<p>In other words, any <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shape is formed by all points in the circular crown, bounded by 2 (concentric) <i>'Circle'</i> shapes (disks) of the same center <i>'(xc,yc)'</i> and of radius <i>'rI'</i> and <i>'rE'</i>, respectively. The disk of radius <i>'rE'</i> is the <i>'external'</i> disk, and the disk of radius <i>'rI'</i> is the <i>'internal'</i> disk.<p>Specifically, this test draws the following variants of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape:<p><ol start='0'>
<li>the variant #0 is not <i>'real'</i>, since it is the result of drawing the approximations of 2 <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shapes, placed at different z-depths. Note that every <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shape is recursively rendered by drawing its <i>'external'</i> (in <i>'red'</i>) and <i>'internal'</i> (in <i>'white'</i>) disks. The scene is drawn by using the orthographic projection, such that the centers for the <i>'Circle'</i> shapes of interest are projected on the same point. Here, the z-buffer (depth test) technique is exploited. Thus, the result will be always the same, despite the rendering order of the <i>'Circle'</i> shapes. Thus, they only seem to approximate the <i>'Circular Annulus'</i> shape, and thus also the <i>'Eight'</i> shape. All <i>'Circle'</i> shapes of interest are approximated by a triangle fan of <i>'n'</i> vertices (including the center).<p></li>
<li>The variant #1 is a real approximation of the <i>'Eight'</i> shape through 2 quad strips (both in <i>'red'</i>), defined over <i>'n'</i> pairs of the corresponding vertices between the approximations of the <i>'Circle'</i> curves, bounding the <i>'Eight'</i> shape. Note that the resulting approximation may be quite different from the approximation, offered by the variant #0.</li></ol><p>
