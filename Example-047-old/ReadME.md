<H3>The <i>'Example-047 (Old Mode)'</i> Test</H3>

The <i>'Example-047 (Old Mode)'</i> Test draws the <i>'Ellipsoid'</i> shape in an <A href="http://www.opengl.org"><i>OpenGL</i></A> window. Intuitively, the <i>'Ellipsoid'</i> shape is a surface, which may be obtained from the <i>'Sphere'</i> shape by deforming it through an affine transformation. Recall that the <i>'Sphere'</i> shape describes a perfectly round geometrical object in the 3D space, that is the surface of a completely round ball. Like the <i>'Circle'</i> shape, which geometrically is an object in the 2D space, the <i>'Sphere'</i> shape is defined mathematically as the set of 3D points, that are at the same distance <code><i>'R'</i></code> from a given point <code><i>'(xc,yc,zc)'</i></code>. The distance <code><i>'R'</i></code> is the <i>'radius'</i> of the <i>'Sphere'</i> shape, and the point <code><i>'(xc,yc,zc)'</i></code> is its <i>'center'</i></code>.<p>In this case, we consider the <i>'Ellipsoid'</i> shape as a variant of the <i>'Sphere'</i> shape of the <i>'center'</i></code> <code><i>'(xc,yc,zc)'</i></code>, and such that its symmetry axes are scaled independently in order to have lengths <code><i>'a'</i>, <i>'b'</i>'</code>, and <code><i>'c'</i></code> (not necessarily all the same). For the sake of the simplicity, the <i>'Ellipsoid'</i> shape is the union of 2 hemi-ellipsoids with the same <i>'center'</i></code> <code><i>'(xc,yc,zc)'</i></code>. In both cases, we consider any <code><i>'a,b,c>0'</i></code>, any <code><i>'r'</i></code> in <code><i>'[ 0, pi/2 ]'</i></code>, and for any <code><i>'s'</i></code> in <code><i>'[ 0, 2*pi ]'</i></code>. The points of the first hemi-ellipsoid are expressed as follows:<p><pre>x(r,s) = xc + a * cos(r) * cos(s), y(r,s) = yc + b * sin(r), z(r,s) = zc + c * cos(r) * sin(s)</pre><p>Instead, the points of the second hemi-ellipsoid are expressed as follows:<p><pre>x(r,s) = xc + a * cos(r) * cos(s), y(r,s) = yc - b * sin(r), z(r,s) = zc + c * cos(r) * sin(s)</pre><p>
